# Design-of-Rectangular-Microstrip-Patch-Antenna
A rectangular microstrip patch antenna has been designed and simulated at 2.4GHz with dielectric thickness of 1.58mm and its relative permittivity is 4.4. 
The radiation patterns and realized gain of Rectangular microstrip patch are plotted on both Gtheta (co-pol & X-pol) and Gphi (co-pol & X-pol) at designed resonating 
frequency. 
The gain of the proposed RMPA is 1.5dB and cross polarization discrimination level is approximately 40dB. 
Results are obtained and compared with analytical values; it gives good agreement of antenna performance.

The rectangular patch is the basic and most commonly used microstrip antenna. 
The basic antenna element is a strip conductor of dimensions L x M on a dielectric substrate of dielectric constant   r 
and thickness h backed by a ground plane. 
When the patch is excited by a feed, a charge distribution is established on a underside of the patch metallization and the ground plane. 
At a particular instant of time, the underside of the patch is positively charged and the ground plane is negatively charged. 
The attractive force between these sets of charges tends to hold a large percentage of the charge between the two surfaces. 
However, the repulsive force between positive charges on the patch pushes some of these charges toward the edges, 
resulting in large charge density at the edges at the edges. 
These charges are the source of fringing field and the associated radiation power can be increased by using a thicker substrate with a lower value of dielectric constant.
